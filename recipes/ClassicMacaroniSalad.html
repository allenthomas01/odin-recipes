    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
        Macaroni salad is a type of pasta salad, served cold, made with cooked elbow macaroni and usually prepared with
        mayonnaise. Much like potato salad or coleslaw in its use, it is often served as a side dish to barbecue, fried
        chicken, or other picnic style dishes. Like any dish, national and regional variations abound but generally it
        is prepared with raw diced onions, dill or sweet pickles and celery and seasoned with salt and pepper.

    <p>
        In the United States, macaroni salad has been described as a "deli staple".In Hawaii, macaroni salad is a
        popular staple in plate lunches and is traditionally made with grated onion and macaroni cooked until very soft.
        In Puerto Rico, macaroni salad may contain mayonnaise, mustard, canned tuna or bits of Spam, onions, Cubanelle
        peppers and pimentos.
